Hello, you. I'm Steve, formerly a PhD student at Kansas State University. Currently, I am an assitant professor with the Department of Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Business at New Mexico State University. If you desire more information about the professional-me, you can find my CV [here](files/CV.pdf). I am still new-ish to R and more newish to Git and GitHub, and this website is basically an outgrowth of my attempts at expanding these skills.

As for the non-professional me, I'm originally from Salina, KS, so I'll always love the Sunflower State. Relatedly, life-long KC Chiefs and KC Royals fan. I've also recently got into homebrewing; I don't *really* know what I'm doing, but it's fun. All of that being said, outside of work, my life mostly revolves around my dog, Kota. She's super, you should get to know her.

**IMPORTANT:** Here is a picture of Kota:
